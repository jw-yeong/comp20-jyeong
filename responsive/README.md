This repo was created for the COMP 20 responsiveness lab at Tufts University.

To my knowledge, everything has been correctly implemented; that is:
- index.html was copied from the COMP 20 site and has not been changed.
- software.png was copied from the COMP 20 site.
- responsive.css was implemented correctly.
However, I have only tested this locally on Safari on my local machine.
I have not had the time to test this on other browsers.

Discussed this assignment with Chris Rackey.
