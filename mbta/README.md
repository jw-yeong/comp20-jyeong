This repo was created for the COMP 20 MBTA assignment at Tufts University.

Worked closely with Chris Rackey; no code was copied.

To my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly. 
However, the train schedule information is not formatted for human readability.
I meant to come back and improve this, but later the API stopped working, 
presumably due to overloading of the class API key. This not only causes no data to be
shown on the windows of stations, but also made it harder for me to
update the readability, so I left it as is.

Please note that the schedule information did successfully display, prior
to the class API key being overloaded! I expect it will display if the class API key
is up and running. See exhibitA.jpg.
